# Online Shop

This project is an online shop built with React, Tailwind CSS, and JSX.

## Description

The online shop allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout to make a purchase. It includes user authentication, so users can create accounts, log in, and see their order history.

## Implementation

The project is divided into several parts:

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS. It includes pages for product listings, individual product details, the shopping cart, and user account management. The components are written in JSX.

- **Backend**: The backend server handles requests from the frontend, such as fetching product data, managing the shopping cart, and processing orders. It's built with a server technology like Node.js or Django.

- **Database**: The database stores product data, user accounts, and order history. It could be a SQL database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.

## Usage

To run the online shop, you'll need to have Node.js installed. Then, you can install the project dependencies with `npm install`, and start the server with `npm start`. Open a web browser, and navigate to the local address of the server (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
